other usefull software:
  gdata
  pep8
  feedparser
  pyparsing

cleanup:
  - datastructures - lots of useless and/or slow crap
    - should probably throw alphabet in there
  - sendmail - lots of junk
  - might want to create a "dev" package where we can throw debug utils and diagrams in there.

get rid of the stuff we've ripped out of IPython, now that it is pretty
standard, easy to install, and has probably improve a great deal.

remove pycolorized

create a separate package for nlp utils

are there other packages for wordnet? installing nltk is a big too big and
complicate (especially b/c it requires getting the datasets), I don't want to
maintain this thing.


autoreload: there have got to be better solutions to this problem...
